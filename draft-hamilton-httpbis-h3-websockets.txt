                  Bootstrapping WebSockets with HTTP/3
                  draft-hamilton-httpbis-h3-websockets

Abstract

   The mechanism for running the WebSocket Protocol over a single stream
   of an HTTP/3 connection is equally applicable to HTTP/3, but need to
   be separately registered.  This document describes the
   SETTINGS_ENABLE_CONNECT_PROTOCOL SETTINGS Parameter for HTTP/3.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC8441] defines an extension to HTTP/2 which is also useful in
   HTTP/3.  Appendix A.2.3 of [HTTP3] describes the required updates for
   HTTP/2 settings to be used with HTTP/3.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   [RFC8441] defines a mechanism for running the WebSocket Protocol
   [RFC6455] over a single stream of an HTTP/2 connection.  This
   includes the use of a new HTTP/2 SETTING send by a server to inform a
   client that it may send the Extended CONNECT.

   The semantics of the headers and SETTING are identical to those in
   HTTP/2 as defined [RFC8441].  The SETTINGS_ENABLE_CONNECT_PROTOCOL
   value is 0x08 (decimal 8), as in HTTP/2.

3.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces no new security considerations beyond those
   discussed in [RFC8841].

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers a new setting in the "HTTP/3 Settings"
   registry ([HTTP3]).
